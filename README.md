# StecaToPVoutput

this script is made to read the "measurements" table on the internal webserver of a Solar Frontier Steca inverter
The measurements table is basicly generated by a javascript function which displays the current values of wattage, voltage and so on
then, these values are uploaded to pvoutput, just enter your api key and id values from pvoutput in this script
Also enter the ip adress of your steca inverter, which is displayed on the inverter itself. Make sure you use a static ip adress

Once you run the script, your local inverter values are collected for that moment and uploaded to pvoutput
I run this script on a raspberry pi (which runs linux for Domoticz) every 5 minutes, so pvoutput is updated frequently
use the following crontab line
